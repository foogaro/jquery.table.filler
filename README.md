table-filler
============

This project aims to explain how to create a __jQuery plug-in__ (minimum jQuery version is 1.4.2).

By the way, I'm going to use this example to build a table filler which loads JSON data from a remote and local resource and puts the data into the table as they are retrieved.

Soon I'll start a new jQuery plug-in project based upon this one to handle pagination!

What you need is:
-----------------

 * jQuery 1.4.2+
 * a browser: Firefox 3+ or Chrome 7+ or Safari (I do not have a Mac so...) - never tested on IE and I will not!

Why am I sharing this?
----------------------

I'm sure I'll need that sooner or later!
